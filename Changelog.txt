+ Fixed the color panel because of a graphic glitch that distorts LIDAR values.

=== 08/05/2016
+ Fixed a bug when a first attempt to start simulation failed, all next attempts would lead to a misc error.
+ Fixed a checkpoint bug that would take the last hit as a Track cleared timer value instead of only taking the first
+ Added timer support for Mac OS (props to dridi_e) . Project tested on 10.11.1 El Capitan. (Ask for download, no support provided)
+ New scenes with new tracks (including a bill-filled track...). (props to kettan_s)

=== 05/05/2016
+ Added a Changelog.txt to keep track of updates.
+ Updated the .ttt files in scene/ to be n4s-compliant with the new sensors CP system.
+ New Checkpoints in the track_1.ttt scene.
+ Sensors handlers can now correctly notify when checkpoints/laps or tracks are cleared.
+ n4s now synchronises with V-REP only when necessary
+ Added "GET_CAR_SPEED_MAX" and "GET_CAR_SPEED_MIN" constant getters callable outside simulations
+ Added "GET_INFO_SIMTIME" command to get simulation running time.
+ ./pipes.sh now correctly silences the prompt
+ More detailed error codes for sensor loading
+ Retrieving data on sensors doesn't contain any dynamic allocations anymore, since
this routine is called a big amount of times through the simulation.
+ Possibility to change the Unique/Several laps mode within the V-REP map conception.
+ Added the MOULINETTE version to the compile options (unavailable to students)

Notes:
- Some return code values are not mentionned in the subject. You don't have to
bother with them in the student version of n4s.
